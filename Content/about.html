    <h1>About Me </h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Hi, I'm an 18-year-old Computer Science student at Chitkara University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been deeply curious about how the world works — especially the logic and precision behind science and mathematics. That curiosity quickly evolved into a fascination with technology, and now, I’m working to turn that passion into a career in programming and software development.</p>
    <p>I believe in the words of Carl Sagan: “Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.” That quote captures how I feel every time I learn something new in science, code a small project, or understand a tough concept. I’m currently teaching myself web development — starting from HTML and CSS, diving into JavaScript, and exploring how real-world websites and applications are built. Even though I’m just starting out, I’m determined to keep building, failing, learning, and growing.</p>
    <p>What excites me most about tech is its power to create. With a few lines of code, we can build tools, solve problems, and bring ideas to life. I don’t have professional experience or projects yet, but I’m actively working to change that. For now, I’m focusing on building a strong foundation — learning the essentials, practicing regularly, and trying to understand not just how something works, but why it works.</p>
    <p>I’m someone who learns best by doing, and I find joy in the process, not just the result. Whether it’s debugging a stubborn error or finally understanding a tricky algorithm, I enjoy the challenge. As I grow, I hope to explore deeper areas like machine learning, ethical AI, and scalable systems — but for now, I’m just focused on learning and laying one brick at a time.</p>
    <p>In the words of Steve Jobs, “Stay hungry, stay foolish.” I plan to keep doing just that — staying curious, staying humble, and always reaching for more.</p>
